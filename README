This is a simple game made with pygame. Hopefully, it may one day implment a
d20-like system. The title is short for "double dungeons rogue" because i
wanted a quick name. Improvements are welcome.

So far:
    Movement        [\]
    Combat          [ ]
    Classes         [ ]
    Enemies         [ ]
    Map creation    [ ]
    Items           [ ]

guide: 
    \: half done
    x: done



Development notes:

The key to everything right now is the EventHandler class, which takes the
player and a path to a keymap, then creates a map from the keys to the
functions they belong to. Then when the EventHandler.end_round method is
called, the program waits for any key input. When it recieves it, it tries to
match the key pressed to a known action and perform that action. Current
actions are square movement (up, down, left and right) and exiting the game.

Next to be developed is likely combat or map creation.
