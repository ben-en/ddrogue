This is a simple game made with pygame. Hopefully, it may one day implment a
d20-like system. The title is short for "double dungeons rogue" because i
wanted a quick name. Improvements are welcome.

So far:
    Menu                            [x]
    Movement                        [\]
    Information display             [\]
    Combat                          [\]
    Feats                           [\]
    Spells                          [ ]
    Skills                          [\]
    Classes                         [\]
    Enemies                         [\]
    Map creation                    [ ]
    Items                           [ ]

guide: 
    \: partially done
    x: done


Controls:
    <-, h: move left
    /\, j: move up
    \/, k: move down
    ->, l: move right
    ESC: quit
    click to move to that location


Next on the list is flush out controls, add UI for combat and skill choices. 
Once UI is in place, special weapon functions such as trip or bull rushing can 
be implemented.


Thoughts:
This is starting to look more like a 2d neverwinter nights than a roguelike.
Having a library which accessed the rule set would be a nice abstraction later
so i could do both. Not sure which would be simpler to get off the ground, a
nwn clone could be done with a dungeon and a city and pronounced version 0.1,
whereas map generation may take a lot of coding.

## Planned Features ##

+ Character creation
    This would be a series of user prompts, such as:
        - Race
        - Class
        - Roll Stats
        - Select Skills
        - Select Feats
        - Start off in town to purchase initial gear from shops, or a tutorial
          world?

+ Races
    Initially just the classic few, Humans, Dwarves, Gnomes, Halfings, Elves.
    Ideally monsters would be implemented in a way that they could be given
    class leveles.

+ Classes
    Ideally all base classes, the differences between a wizard and a sorcerer
    are quite pronounced in a game.
    Theoretically prestige classes as well once there's enough content to get
    to level 10.

+ Equpment
    Such as swords, spears, bows, armor, shields, rope, camping gear, etc.

+ Skills
    Skills must be examined for usefulness. Some, like spellcraft or climb,
    present obvious merit in certain circumstances.

+ Feats
    Feats likewise must be examined for simple to implement cases such as skill
    boosts, metamagic feats, or item creation feats.

+ Spells
    Spell per day system sounds fine, but doing it this way may make soloing
    less desireable.

+ Combat rules
    All things available in pathfinder should be available, reach based on size
    or weapons, tripping, falling prone, etc. Iirc pathfinder also has stances,
    which might be interesting.

+ Craft/Magic Item creation
    System already exists, requires XP, knowledge of the spells, gold and
    ingredients.

+ Map Generation
    Unsure if completely generated or hand made.
    A global map so more non-combat equipment and skills are useful, with
    cities where you can purchase, steal, and interact normally.
