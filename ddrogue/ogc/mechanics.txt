## Planned Features ##

+ Character creation
    This would be a series of user prompts, such as:
        - Race
        - Class
        - Roll Stats
        - Select Skills
        - Select Feats
        - Start off in town to purchase initial gear from shops, or a tutorial
          world?

+ Races
    Initially just the classic few, Humans, Dwarves, Gnomes, Halfings, Elves.
    Ideally monsters would be implemented in a way that they could be given
    class leveles.

+ Classes
    Ideally all base classes, the differences between a wizard and a sorcerer
    are quite pronounced in a game.
    Theoretically prestige classes as well once there's enough content to get
    to level 10.

+ Equpment
    Such as swords, spears, bows, armor, shields, rope, camping gear, etc.

+ Skills
    Skills must be examined for usefulness. Some, like spellcraft or climb,
    present obvious merit in certain circumstances.

+ Feats
    Feats likewise must be examined for simple to implement cases such as skill
    boosts, metamagic feats, or item creation feats.

+ Spells
    Spell per day system sounds fine, but doing it this way may make soloing
    less desireable.

+ Combat rules
    All things available in pathfinder should be available, reach based on size
    or weapons, tripping, falling prone, etc. Iirc pathfinder also has stances,
    which might be interesting.

+ Craft/Magic Item creation
    System already exists, requires XP, knowledge of the spells, gold and
    ingredients.

+ Map Generation
    Unsure if completely generated or hand made.
    A global map so more non-combat equipment and skills are useful, with
    cities where you can purchase, steal, and interact normally.
