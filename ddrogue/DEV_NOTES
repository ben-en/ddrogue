Encounter flow:

When EncounterState is initialized, all the properties are initialized and 
characters are sorted by rolling initiative. Next the game enters a loop while
loop, while not state.quit infinitely calling state.next_turn().

state.next_turn() tracks the current character's initiative on the property
'active_player'. state.char property method returns
state.players[state.active_player]. next_turn() calls interact_until_action()
which displays the UI and allows the user to interact with the UI, finally
returning the event when the UI returns an event. 

For instance, if you click on the map, the event would be returned and used as
an argument for the action mapped (in this case pygame.MOUSEBUTTONUP). When you
push left or right, the event is returned so it can be mapped to the keymap.
